ModMove v. 1.0

MoveMove can automatically scan your Starbound steam workshop directory for .pak files, rename them, and move them to your Starbound installation's mod directory.
You can enter custom directories for your Steam installation, as well as a custom directory for your Starbound installation.
You can enter no directory to use the default location that most 64 bit Windows installations on C:/ use.


INSTRUCTIONS:
- Run modmove.py using a Python 3 installation
- Enter your Steam directory, or enter nothing to use the default.
- Enter your Starbound directory, or enter nothing to use the default.
- Your mods will then automatically be moved and renamed!
